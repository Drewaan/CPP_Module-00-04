# CPP Modules 00–04 — C++ Fundamentals

This repository contains my implementation of **C++ Modules 00 to 04** from the 42 curriculum.  
These projects introduce the core features of **C++ and Object-Oriented Programming**, following the **C++98 standard**.

---

## 📚 Overview

The modules progressively cover:

- C++ basic syntax and program structure  
- Classes, encapsulation, and object lifecycle  
- Constructors, destructors, and canonical form  
- Operator overloading  
- Inheritance and polymorphism  
- Abstract classes and interfaces

## 🗂 Repository Structure

```
CPP_Module-xx
  ├── 📄 Makefile
  ├── 📂 src/
      ├── *.cpp files 
  ├── 📂 inc/
      ├── *.hpp files 
```


Each module contains multiple independent exercises, each with its own `Makefile`.

---

## 🛠 Build and Run

```bash
cd CPP_Module-XX/exYY
make
./exYY
```

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository demonstrates:

- A solid understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming in C++**
- Proper class design and encapsulation
- Correct use of inheritance and polymorphism
- A clean transition from procedural C to C++
